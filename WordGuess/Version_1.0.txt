//*******************************              HANGMAN              *******************************//

					This is the first operational version on the HangMan game.

The purpose of this game to to make developers more familiar with the process of  Java Swing Software
Development. This is just the first phase of the Game Implementation. The next phase of the game will
require the team to develop a server built in C++ that will use UDP operations. They will develop the
server in a Publisher Subscriber Architecture. This will also enhance the developers skills with more
knowledge in regards to the C++ style architecture as well as how Publisher  Subscriber  Architecture
works.
